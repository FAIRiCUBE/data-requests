### Why is the data collection mentioned in the title useful?
The Urban Atlas is the reference land use/land cover layer for urban areas, so it is very much needed for stocks and changes of land use/land cover over time.

### Where can the collection be found (e.g. links, organisation, etc.)
- Copernicus Land Monitoring Service website: https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas
- download of vector data for 2018: https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2018?tab=download
- download of vector data for 2012: https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2012?tab=download
- download of vector data for 2006: https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2006?tab=download

### Additional Information
The Urban Atlas is basically available as vector data, but for the cube we need raster data. Those raster data have been produced by the ETC DI using the JEDI platform (not public). The data can be accessed from there.
