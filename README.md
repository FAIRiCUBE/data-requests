# Data Requests

This space is used for issues and documentation (until a canonical documentation place has been defined) of data ingestion as part of Fairicube WP5 work.

As data ingest is tightly connected with metadata management, use of data, etc., consider also these related spaces:

- [resource-metadata](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/resource-metadata): in addition to the issues providing metadata for resources, also used to discuss technical details on resource metadata
- [Fairicube Hub](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/FAIRiCUBE-Hub-issue-tracker): for general FAIRiCUBE topics

In a nutshell, data needed by the Use Cases will be imported into the FAIRiCUBE HUB to form datacubes. These make data access easier as they are homogenized in structure and access (if you ever had to go through different data repositories and harvest data, followed by own homogenization work, you will see that pushing that work "behind the curtain" by automating access is a big advantage). Of course, in order to provide data in such a "beautified" manner the homogenization work still needs to be done by somebody. In FC, that is: us. Tools like the data request form and the rasdaman ETL suite assist greatly, but for the final homogenized datacubes human caring hands are still necessary given the vast divergence of data; improving life of data wranglers is a key mission of the project, actually.
