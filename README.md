# Data Requests

Data needed by the Use Cases will be imported into the FAIRiCUBE HUB to form datacubes. These make data accesseasier as they are homogenized in structure and access (if you ever had to go through different data repositories and harvest data, followed by own homogenization work, you will see that pushing that work "behind the curtain" by automating access is a big advantage). Of course, in order to provide data in such a "beautified" manner the homogenization work still needs to be done by somebody. In FC, that is: us. Tools like the data request form and the rasdaman ETL suite assist greatly, but for the final homogenized datacubes human caring hands are still necessary given the vast divergence of data; improving life of data wranglers is a key mission of the project, actually.

## How to Get Data Added

Please hand in your requests for data to be made available within FAIRiCUBE HUB by simply adding an issue in this repository; this will add your request to the queue.

**Make sure the description is correct and complete, otherwise iterations and misinterpretations can occur which lead to delays and extra effort.**

If questions remain open (and this has turned out to be the regular case) a request clearing meeting will be held subsequently. Commonly, details can be clarified this way, or the data requestor gets asked to provide more technical details on the data. After successful data import the requestor will be contacted for verification, after which the git issue gets closed.

## Metadata

In order to become visible to all, the new data set also needs to get its twin entry in the catalog (currently: one of  https://catalog.eoxhub.fairicube.eu and https://catalog.fairicube.eu). To this end, the catalog team needs to get contacted. Note that the catalog typically will require additional descriptive metadata.

## Existing Data Catalogs

A [list of data catalogs](../../wiki/Data-Catalogs) can be found in the Wiki. Please add data catalogs that are not on the list yet if you feel they are relevant as sources. Note, however, that this does not constintute a data request: no import action is associated with that list per se.
